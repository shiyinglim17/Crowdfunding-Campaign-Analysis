# Crowdfunding-Campaign-Analysis
Tool for predicting Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign success using text analytics and live data scraping

### Featured Project: [Kickstarter Campaign Success Predictor](https://github.com/joelleoqiyi/crowdfunding-analysis.git)

I contributed to this collaborative project by developing a real-time prediction dashboard that assesses Kickstarter campaign success using both textual and numerical features. My work focused on building explainable machine learning models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression), creating a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard, and integrating it into our team’s main website. I engineered features from over 30,000 campaign entries, applied TF-IDF for keyword extraction, and tuned models to achieve 84% accuracy using both text and metadata. I also styled the dashboard using Tailwind-inspired CSS and linked it to the main site through a backend solution combining Flask and Streamlit.

Key contributions:
- Built and trained interpretable models to predict campaign success.
- Developed a Streamlit-based UI for real-time, user-driven predictions.
- Engineered and cleaned datasets from Kickstarter campaigns (text and metadata).
- Extracted success-driving keywords and numerical thresholds from campaign data.
- Integrated the dashboard with the team’s main website and backend API.

Key learnings:
- Applied decision tree explainability (Gini impurity, feature importance) for actionable insights.
- Gained hands-on experience with NLP tools like TF-IDF, VADER, and OpenAI's API.
- Developed modular back-end pipelines for model deployment and live inference.
- Learned front-end integration challenges (e.g., styling conflicts with Streamlit) and how to bridge React and Streamlit apps.

**Team Achievements:**  
Our team built a modular, AI-powered tool that predicts campaign success by analyzing Kickstarter descriptions, updates, comments, and YouTube feedback. We achieved:
- Up to 87% accuracy using fine-tuned BERT models for YouTube comments.
- 80% accuracy from campaign updates using XGBoost.
- A Flask + React + Streamlit platform integrating four predictive pipelines.
- A unified tool that provides creators with deeper, text-driven insights beyond standard funding metrics.

Key technologies: Python, Streamlit, Flask, scikit-learn, TF-IDF, decision trees, logistic regression, VADER, OpenAI API.
